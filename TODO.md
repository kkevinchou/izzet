# TODO

# Lighting
* Distance fog
* Distance blur
* Screen Space Ambient Occlusion

# Water
* realistic water rendering like sea of thieves

# Geometry
* Experiment with using half edges

# Other
* parent scale transforms should not affect the translation of its children
* refactor MeshSpecification to instead refer to primitives. VAOs are at the primitive level (one material/texture, one set of positions) rather than at the mesh level
